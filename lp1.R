# A trading company is looking for a way to maximize profit per transportation of their goods. The company has a train available with 3 wagons. When stocking the wagons they can choose between 4 types of cargo, 
# each with its own specifications. 
# How much of each cargo type should 
# be loaded on which wagon in order to maximize profit?
